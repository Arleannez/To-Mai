          My Love, 
          One month with you and somehow, it already feels like my heart learned a
            new rhythm. I never expected that in such a short time, someone
            could mean this much to me, but here you are, quietly becoming one
            of the best parts of my life. Thank you for choosing me, for
            staying, and for letting me love you in my own imperfect ways.
            You’ve seen my random thoughts, my moods, and my awkward moments and
            yet you’re still here.
            <br><br>
            I think that alone deserves appreciation. This month wasn’t just about counting
            days. It was about the moments in between the late talks, the
            laughter that came out of nowhere, the way missing you made me
            realize how deeply I care. 
            <br><br>
            You made ordinary days feel warmer and
            waiting feel worth it. I appreciate the way you understand me, even
            when I don’t explain myself well. The way you’re patient, gentle,
            and honest with your feelings. Loving you feels safe, and that’s
            something I don’t take lightly. You made me feel seen, valued, and
            chosen and that means more to me than I can fully put into words.
            Sometimes I catch myself smiling for no reason, then I realize… it’s
            you. (so cheesy, I know, but it’s true)
            <br><br>
            You’ve become the thought that sneaks in when my mind is quiet,
            the comfort I look for at the end of the day. If one month can feel
            this deep, I can only imagine what more time with you will bring. I
            won’t pretend everything will always be perfect, but I promise to
            always be real with you, to grow with you, and to choose you even on
            the days when things feel heavy. Thank you for being my partner, my
            safe place, and my favorite person to think about. Happy one month
            to us. We made it here together, and I wouldn’t want to be on this
            journey with anyone else. Here’s to more love, more memories, more
            laughter and maybe a little more missing each other in between.

           Mai à, chỉ một tháng thôi nhưng em đã trở thành điều dịu dàng nhất trong tim em. Cảm ơn em vì đã đến, vì đã ở lại, và vì đã 
            cho em một lý do để mỉm cười mỗi ngày.
            Em mong được nắm tay em và cùng em đi thật xa, 
            từng ngày một.(had a little help with google on this one hehe).
            <br><br>
            Always and only yours, 
            <br><br>
